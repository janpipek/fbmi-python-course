    "Bonus tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file `data/us-cities.csv` contains many more cities, without population. You may add them as tiny dots.\n",
    "- Using https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/ as inspiration (there is an example with U.S. states), you may show the states of the U.S. in a map, color-coded by their relative increase/decrease in population since 2010 (or by some other interesting quantity)"

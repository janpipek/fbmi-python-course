    "# Installation instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes how to prepare your own PC for the first lecture. \n",
    "It should take less than one hour to complete.\n",
    "*Please, really do it and let us know if there are any complications.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended: Installing Python using miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our preferred way how to install Python for scientific computing as it seamlessly bundles required binary (even non-Python) packages\n",
    "and works almost identically on all major platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Python 3.10 version of miniconda for your operating system from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.\n",
    "2. Follow the \"Regular installation\" instructions in https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On MacOS, run\n",
    "```\n",
    "bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "On Linux:\n",
    "```\n",
    "bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "On Windows, execute the downloaded `.exe` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verify the installation.\n",
    "    * If you are unsure about things like environment variables etc., restart your system first.\n",
    "    * Open a terminal with conda initialized as described in https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html.\n",
    "    * Verify conda installation by running `conda --version`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a dedicated virtual environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n python-course-2023 -c conda-forge python=3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Activate this new environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate python-course-2023\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Install required packages (always do this after activating the correct conda environment):\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge numpy jupyterlab astropy pandas xarray matplotlib plotly seaborn lxml openpyxl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it takes a significant amount of time to download and install all the packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative: System Python in Ubuntu\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a recent version of Ubuntu (say 22.04 LTS), you should have a recommended version of Python (3.10)\n",
    "already installed on your system. In such case, just make sure you have the `python3.10-venv` and `python3.10-pip`\n",
    "packages installed as well. You will need to work in a \"virtual environment\" to install the necessary libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a directory of your choice, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m venv ./python-course-venv         # Create the environment (once)\n",
    "source ./python-course-venv/bin/activate      # Use the environment (every time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can install the required libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install wheel\n",
    "pip install -U pip\n",
    "pip install numpy jupyterlab astropy pandas xarray matplotlib plotly seaborn lxml openpyxl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative: Download from official website\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially in Windows, you can download the latest version (or perhaps slightly older, such as 3.10.10)\n",
    "of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you type `python` in the command line of a Windows computer with Python installed, it will\n",
    "open a Microsoft Store page that offers to install it. This *might* work as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then follow the steps for installing libraries using `pip` (as above).\n"

    "## On-line alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the many on-line \"notebook\" environments, we have quite good experience with (Deepnote)[https://www.deepnote.com].\n",
    "For reasonably complex projects (such as our tutorial), it allows to work completely on-line without any\n",

    "\n",
    "[Create a DeepNote project](https://deepnote.com/launch?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjanpipek%2Ffbmi-python-course)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further alternatives? Rather not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that basically any installation of relatively new Python (version 3.7 or higher) is capable of installing the requested\n",
    "libraries and running the code we will show during the course but... the small \"but\" is in that there may be small glitches or inconsistencies\n",
    "that would typically occur during the lecture when the time should be devoted to other topics. We simply cannot give support and you are on your own.\n",
    "*(Please, let us know if you really really must work in an environment different from the abovementioned alternatives.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook environment, which is a web-based application that allows to run Python code\n",
    "and combine it seamlesly with graphical output and user interaction. Notebooks thus enable creating and working with live documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please try to start Jupyter Notebook server as described in https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html.\n",
    "Play a little bit around with the [Notebook Basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended development environments / editors\n",
    "\n",
    "A capable, Python-aware editor or integrated development environment (IDE) becomes indispensable\n",
    "once you start with a more \"serious\" development: larger projects, shared packages etc.\n",
    "We have short-listed community and personally proven possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general, multi-purpose and very capable free editor, not just for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the [official tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)\n",
    "to get started with Python in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a heavy-weight, full IDE dedicated to Python, probably the most powerful one. Although there is a Professional version,\n",
    "in scientific computing, with the Community edition you will be just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notepad++, vim, emacs, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Many text editors have at least some basic syntax highlighting for Python, so don't be afraid to use your favourite one."

Plotly Express is a built-in part of the `plotly`\n","library, and is the recommended starting point for creating most common\n","figures. Every Plotly Express function uses [graph\n","objects](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/) internally and returns a\n","`plotly.graph_objects.Figure` instance. Throughout the `plotly`\n","documentation, you will find the Plotly Express way of building figures\n","at the top of any applicable page, followed by a section on how to use\n","graph objects to build similar figures. Any figure created in a single\n","function call with Plotly Express could be created using graph objects\n","alone, but with between 5 and 100 times more code.\n","\n","Plotly Express provides [more than 30 functions for creating different\n","types of\n","figures](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.express.html).\n","The API for these functions was carefully designed to be as consistent\n","and easy to learn as possible, making it easy to switch from a scatter\n","plot to a bar chart to a histogram to a sunburst chart throughout a data\n","exploration session. *Scroll down for a gallery of Plotly Express plots,\n","each made in a single function call.*\n","\n","Plotly Express currently includes the following functions:\n","\n","-   **Basics**: [`scatter`](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/),\n","    [`line`](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/),\n","    [`area`](https://plotly.com/python/filled-area-plots/), [`bar`](https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/),\n","    [`funnel`](https://plotly.com/python/funnel-charts/),\n","    [`timeline`](https://plotly.com/python/gantt/)\n","-   **Part-of-Whole**: [`pie`](https://plotly.com/python/pie-charts/),\n","    [`sunburst`](https://plotly.com/python/sunburst-charts/),\n","    [`treemap`](https://plotly.com/python/treemaps/),\n","    [`funnel_area`](https://plotly.com/python/funnel-charts/)\n","-   **1D Distributions**: [`histogram`](https://plotly.com/python/histograms/),\n","    [`box`](https://plotly.com/python/box-plots/), [`violin`](https://plotly.com/python/violin/),\n","    [`strip`](https://plotly.com/python/strip-charts/)\n","-   **2D Distributions**: [`density_heatmap`](https://plotly.com/python/2D-Histogram/),\n","    [`density_contour`](https://plotly.com/python/2d-histogram-contour/)\n","-   **Matrix Input**: [`imshow`](https://plotly.com/python/imshow/)\n","-   **3-Dimensional**: [`scatter_3d`](https://plotly.com/python/3d-scatter-plots/),\n","    [`line_3d`](https://plotly.com/python/3d-line-plots/)\n","-   **Multidimensional**: [`scatter_matrix`](https://plotly.com/python/splom/),\n","    [`parallel_coordinates`](https://plotly.com/python/parallel-coordinates-plot/),\n","    [`parallel_categories`](https://plotly.com/python/parallel-categories-diagram/)\n","-   **Tile Maps**: [`scatter_mapbox`](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/),\n","    [`line_mapbox`](https://plotly.com/python/lines-on-mapbox/),\n","    [`choropleth_mapbox`](https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-county-choropleth/),\n","    [`density_mapbox`](https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-density-heatmaps/)\n","-   **Outline Maps**: [`scatter_geo`](https://plotly.com/python/scatter-plots-on-maps/),\n","    [`line_geo`](https://plotly.com/python/lines-on-maps/),\n","    [`choropleth`](https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/)\n","-   **Polar Charts**: [`scatter_polar`](https://plotly.com/python/polar-chart/),\n","    [`line_polar`](https://plotly.com/python/polar-chart/),\n","    [`bar_polar`](https://plotly.com/python/wind-rose-charts/)\n","-   **Ternary Charts**: [`scatter_ternary`](https://plotly.com/python/ternary-plots/),\n","    [`line_ternary`](https://plotly.com/python/ternary-plots/)\n","\n","### High-Level Features\n","\n","The Plotly Express API in general offers the following features:\n","\n","-   **A single entry point into `plotly`**: just\n","    `import plotly.express as px` and get access to [all the plotting\n","    functions](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.express.html),\n","    plus [built-in demo datasets under\n","    `px.data`](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.data.html#module-plotly.data)\n","    and [built-in color scales and sequences under\n","    `px.color`](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.colors.html#module-plotly.colors).\n","    Every PX function returns a `plotly.graph_objects.Figure` object, so\n","    you can edit it using all the same methods like [`update_layout` and\n","    `add_trace`](https://plotly.com/python/creating-and-updating-figures/#updating-figures).\n","-   **Sensible, Overrideable Defaults**: PX functions will infer\n","    sensible defaults wherever possible, and will always let you\n","    override them.\n","-   **Flexible Input Formats**: PX functions [accept input in a variety\n","    of formats](https://plotly.com/python/px-arguments/), from `list`s and `dict`s to\n","    [long-form or wide-form Pandas `DataFrame`s](https://plotly.com/python/wide-form/) to\n","    [`numpy` arrays and `xarrays`](https://plotly.com/python/imshow/) to [GeoPandas\n","    `GeoDataFrames`](https://plotly.com/python/maps/).\n","-   **Automatic Trace and Layout configuration**: PX functions will\n","    create one [trace](https://plotly.com/python/figure-structure) per animation frame for\n","    each unique combination of data values mapped to discrete color,\n","    symbol, line-dash, facet-row and/or facet-column. Traces\\'\n","    `legendgroup` and `showlegend` attributed are set such that only one\n","    legend item appears per unique combination of discrete color, symbol\n","    and/or line-dash. Traces are automatically linked to a\n","    correctly-configured [subplot of the appropriate\n","    type](https://plotly.com/python/figure-structure).\n","-   **Automatic Figure Labelling**: PX functions label axes, legends and\n","    colorbars based in the input `DataFrame` or `xarray`, and provide\n","    [extra control with the `labels`\n","    argument](https://plotly.com/python/styling-plotly-express/).\n","-   **Automatic Hover Labels**: PX functions populate the hover-label\n","    using the labels mentioned above, and provide [extra control with\n","    the `hover_name` and `hover_data`\n","    arguments](https://plotly.com/python/hover-text-and-formatting/).\n","-   **Styling Control**: PX functions [read styling information from the\n","    default figure template](https://plotly.com/python/styling-plotly-express/), and\n","    support commonly-needed [cosmetic controls like `category_orders`\n","    and `color_discrete_map`](https://plotly.com/python/styling-plotly-express/) to\n","    precisely control categorical variables.\n","-   **Uniform Color Handling**: PX functions automatically switch\n","    between [continuous](https://plotly.com/python/colorscales/) and [categorical\n","    color](https://plotly.com/python/discrete-color/) based on the input type.\n","-   **Faceting**: the 2D-cartesian plotting functions support [row,\n","    column and wrapped facetting with `facet_row`, `facet_col` and\n","    `facet_col_wrap` arguments](https://plotly.com/python/facet-plots/).\n","-   **Marginal Plots**: the 2D-cartesian plotting functions support\n","    [marginal distribution plots](https://plotly.com/python/marginal-plots/) with the\n","    `marginal`, `marginal_x` and

can call them via `df.plot()`.\n","-   **Trendlines**: `px.scatter` supports [built-in trendlines with\n","    accessible model output](https://plotly.com/python/linear-fits/).\n","-   **Animations**: many PX functions support [simple animation support\n","    via the `animation_frame` and `animation_group`\n","
